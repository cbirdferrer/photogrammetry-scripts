Hi! This tool will give you a .csv that gives the time correction factors for the matchup scripts.
Heres what you need to do:
1. Make a .csv called "GPStime_images" with a column called ImageName and another called GPStime
	*I've left the .csv I used for the one ocean trip as an example*

1a. The ImageName should be a column of all the images with pictures of the GPS
	GPStime should be the GPS time from all those images

2. Copy all the GPS images into the folder called 'images'

3. Drag the script file ('TimeCorrectionCalculator.py') into command prompt and hit enter!

4. A box will open asking you to select the folder that contains the images folder and the csv
	once you select the folder it'll run
